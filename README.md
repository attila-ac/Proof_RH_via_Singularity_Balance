Timeline and Notes:
- The manuscript was finalized and submitted to the **Annals of Mathematics** on **December 24, 2024**.
- On **December 25, 2024**, the LaTeX template was updated from the specific **aomart** format used for submission to the Annals of Mathematics to a more general template for broader accessibility. No substantive changes were made to the content of the manuscript.
- Formalization branch was added on the 2nd of January, 2025 with initial commits using coq proof assistant.
- On 4th of January an error was spotted related to how the trivial poles arise and the manuscript was updated and resubmitted with a fix. The primary fix pertains to the explicit introduction of trivial poles in the Hadamard product formulation and this oversight necessitated revisions to sections addressing the functional equation, Hadamard product, and related zeropole balance mechanics. While these changes refine the details of the framework. Tthe core structure of the proof—built upon the zeropole balance framework—remains intact.
