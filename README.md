Timeline and Notes:
- The manuscript was finalized and submitted to the **Annals of Mathematics** on **December 24, 2024**.
- On **December 25, 2024**, the LaTeX template was updated from the specific **aomart** format used for submission to the Annals of Mathematics to a more general template for broader accessibility. No substantive changes were made to the content of the manuscript.
- Formalization branch was added on the 2nd of January, 2025 with initial commits using coq proof assistant.
- On 4th of January an error was spotted related to how the trivial poles arise and the manuscript was updated and resubmitted with a fix. The primary fix pertains to the explicit introduction of trivial poles in the Hadamard product formulation and this oversight necessitated revisions to sections addressing the functional equation, Hadamard product, and related zeropole balance mechanics. While these changes refine the details of the framework. Tthe core structure of the proof—built upon the zeropole balance framework—remains intact.

Peer Review:
The manuscript received an initial review from the Annals of Mathematics in January 2025:
1. Original submission: December 24, 2024
2. Resubmission with fixes: January 4, 2025
3. Review received: January 9, 2025
4. Response submitted: January 10, 2025

The peer review documentation can be found in `/submissions/annals-2024-12/`:
- `rejection-letter.pdf`: Official response from Annals of Mathematics
- `rejection-letter-screenshot.png`: Screenshot of the original email
- `technical_response_to_reviewer.pdf`: Detailed technical response addressing the reviewer's concerns

The review focused on the Davenport-Heilbronn paper (1936) about zeros of certain Dirichlet series. Our response demonstrates why this comparison overlooks the fundamental geometric and algebraic machinery of our proof, including:
- Zeropole perpendicularity framework
- Riemann-Roch machinery on compactified surfaces
- Minimality arguments through divisor theory
- Shadow function construction

LLM Testing Section:
To stress-test the proposed proof, advanced large language models (LLMs) were tasked with analyzing the manuscript for any technical issues. The models evaluated the core manuscript and its version with appendices designed to preemptively address naive objections. 

Prompt Used:
"You know the biggest open problem in mathematics is the Riemann Hypothesis unsolved since 1859 and the best smartest mathematicians tried to solve it in the 150+ years since to no avail, but I think I have now proved it, attached please find the manuscript, and it is beautiful, please scrutinize it as much as you can. I mean, I am asking you to try to kill the proof unless you can see yourself that it is correct. I mean, what are the chances? Let’s see. Please do your best to refute, or if you cannot refute, then at least confirm or acknowledge that you don't see any real technical issues with it."

LLM Models and Results:
1. **ChatGPT 4o**: Acknowledged the proof's rigor and raised no substantive technical objections after detailed scrutiny.
2. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Validated the framework and found no flaws in the mathematical reasoning presented.
3. **Gemini Advanced 1.5 Pro**: Provided a thorough analysis but could not raise any technical challenges to the core arguments.
4. **Grok 2**: Highlighted the proof's logical coherence and aligned with other models in not identifying any critical flaws.

Manuscripts Used:
- Core Manuscript: `manuscript_RH_via_Zeropole_Balance_Attila_Csordas_01042025_resubmission.pdf`
- Expanded Manuscript: `RH_proof_via_zeropole_balance_plus_appendix_Attila_Csordas.pdf`

Observations:
- None of the models raised significant technical objections.
- Two models (ChatGPT 4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) expressed apparent confidence in the proof's validity.
- This stress-testing exercise demonstrates the capability of modern LLMs to analyze advanced mathematical arguments, with limitations in challenging novel frameworks.

Purpose:
The repository serves to:
1. Provide a timestamped public preprint version of the manuscript.
2. Facilitate open feedback and discussion on the proposed proof.
3. Document the peer review process and responses transparently
4. Testing the proof with advanced llm models and vice versa
