# Formalization of the Riemann Hypothesis Proof via Zeropole Balance

This repository contains an ongoing formalization of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) proof using the Zeropole Balance framework within the Coq proof assistant. The goal is to ensure the mathematical rigor of the proof by enabling formal verification in Coq.

## Project Structure

### Key Files and Directories

1. **`_CoqProject`**  
   Specifies the namespace and paths for the Coq files. It ensures that all files in the `formalization` directory are correctly linked under the `Formalization` namespace.

2. **Files:**
   - **`define_complex.v`**  
     Contains definitions and operations for complex numbers (`C` type). Includes placeholders for exponential, trigonometric, and gamma functions. This forms the foundational framework for the formalization.  
     **Check Screenshot:** `define_complex_check_screenshot.png`
   - **`shadow_function_degree.v`**  
     Implements degree computation logic for shadow functions, explicitly handling infinity using `aleph_null`.  
     **Check Screenshot:** `shadow_function_degree_check_screenshot.png`
   - **`trigonometric_exponential_constants.v`**  
     Adds placeholders for trigonometric and exponential operations using the `define_complex` library. Demonstrates further development towards the functional equation formalization.
   - **`Hadamard_product.v`**  
     Provides a modular implementation of the Hadamard product formula, decomposing the Riemann zeta function into contributions from zeros and trivial poles. Supports flexibility in testing and verifying combinations of zeros and poles.  
     **New Section Added**
   - **`Truncated_Hadamard_Poles.v`**  
     Debugs and verifies the truncated Hadamard product representation using up to three trivial poles, emphasizing the non-standard component of the proof.  
     **New Section Added**

### Utility Scripts

- **`compile_with_feedback.sh`**  
  A helper script to compile individual Coq files and provide feedback. The script leverages `_CoqProject` to manage the namespace and dependencies.

- **Makefile:**  
  Auto-generated by `coq_makefile` to compile all formalization files using the `_CoqProject` configuration.

### Screenshots

- `define_complex_check_screenshot.png`  
  Shows successful compilation of `define_complex.v`.
- `shadow_function_degree_check_screenshot.png`  
  Demonstrates verification of degree computations.

## Compilation and Execution

### Prerequisites

- Coq (v8.19.2 or later) must be installed and available on the PATH.
- Ensure that the `_CoqProject` file is correctly set up in the `formalization` directory.

### Compilation Steps

1. **Using the Script:**
   - Compile a specific file with the helper script:  
     ```bash
     ./compile_with_feedback.sh <filename.v>
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     ./compile_with_feedback.sh Hadamard_product.v
     ```

2. **Using Makefile:**
   - Compile all files in the project:  
     ```bash
     make
     ```

3. **CoqIDE or VSCode:**  
   Open the `formalization` directory as a project in CoqIDE or VSCode (with the Coq extension) to interactively verify proofs.

## File Details

### `Hadamard_product.v`

This file implements a modular approach to the Hadamard product for the Riemann zeta function, separating the contributions from non-trivial zeros and trivial poles.

- **Core Definitions:**
  - `hadamard_term`: Defines the Hadamard term for non-trivial zeros.
  - `hadamard_term_pole`: Defines the Hadamard term for trivial poles.
  - `hadamard_zeros`: Processes the contribution from non-trivial zeros.
  - `hadamard_poles`: Processes the contribution from trivial poles.
  - `hadamard_product`: Combines the contributions from zeros and poles.

- **Test Cases:**
  - `test_hadamard_product`: Tests the combined Hadamard product for specific zeros and poles.
  - `test_hadamard_zeros_only`: Tests the product for zeros only.
  - `test_hadamard_poles_only`: Tests the product for poles only.

### `Truncated_Hadamard_Poles.v`

This file focuses on debugging and verifying the truncated Hadamard product involving up to three trivial poles.

- **Core Definitions:**
  - `hadamard_term_pole`: Represents the Hadamard term for trivial poles.
  - `first_trivial_pole`, `second_trivial_pole`, `third_trivial_pole`: Explicit definitions for the first three trivial poles (\(-2, -4, -6\)).
  - `hadamard_product_three_poles`: Computes the truncated Hadamard product for these three poles.

- **Theorems and Tests:**
  - Verifies that the computed product for one, two, or three poles matches explicitly defined expected results.
  - Debugging outputs (`Eval compute`) ensure correct computation at each step.

- **Key Theorem:**
  - `test_three_trivial_poles`: Validates the computed Hadamard product against the explicitly defined product for three trivial poles.

2. **Trigonometric and Exponential Constants (`trigonometric_exponential_constants.v`):**
   - Builds on `define_complex.v` to formalize trigonometric and exponential functions.
   - Includes example theorems as placeholders for further development.

3. **Hadamard Product Testing:**
   - `Hadamard_product.v`: Implements and tests the modular Hadamard product framework.
