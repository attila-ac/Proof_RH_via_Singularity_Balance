Formalization of the Riemann Hypothesis Proof via Zeropole Balance

This repository contains an ongoing formalization of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) proof using the Zeropole Balance framework within the Coq proof assistant. The goal is to ensure the mathematical rigor of the proof by enabling formal verification in Coq.

Project Structure

Key Files and Directories

1. **`_CoqProject`**  
   Specifies the namespace and paths for the Coq files. It ensures that all files in the `formalization` directory are correctly linked under the `Formalization` namespace.

2. **Files:**
   - **`define_complex.v`**  
     Contains definitions and operations for complex numbers (`C` type). Includes placeholders for exponential, trigonometric, and gamma functions. This forms the foundational framework for the formalization.  
     **Check Screenshot:** `define_complex_check_screenshot.png`
   - **`shadow_function_degree.v`**  
     Implements degree computation logic for shadow functions, explicitly handling infinity using `aleph_null`.  
     **Check Screenshot:** `shadow_function_degree_check_screenshot.png`
   - **`trigonometric_exponential_constants.v`**  
     Adds placeholders for trigonometric and exponential operations using the `define_complex` library. Demonstrates further development towards the functional equation formalization.

3. **Utility Scripts:**
   - **`compile_with_feedback.sh`**  
     A helper script to compile individual Coq files and provide feedback. The script leverages `_CoqProject` to manage the namespace and dependencies.

4. **Makefile:**  
   Auto-generated by `coq_makefile` to compile all formalization files using the `_CoqProject` configuration.

5. **Screenshots:**  
   - `define_complex_check_screenshot.png`  
     Shows successful compilation of `define_complex.v`.
   - `shadow_function_degree_check_screenshot.png`  
     Demonstrates verification of degree computations.

Compilation and Execution

Prerequisites
- Coq (v8.19.2 or later) must be installed and available on the PATH.
- Ensure that the `_CoqProject` file is correctly set up in the `formalization` directory.

Compilation Steps

1. **Using the Script:**
   - Compile a specific file with the helper script:  
     ```bash
     ./compile_with_feedback.sh <filename.v>
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     ./compile_with_feedback.sh trigonometric_exponential_constants.v
     ```

2. **Using Makefile:**
   - Compile all files in the project:  
     ```bash
     make
     ```

3. **CoqIDE or VSCode:**  
   Open the `formalization` directory as a project in CoqIDE or VSCode (with the Coq extension) to interactively verify proofs.

`_CoqProject` File Configuration
The `_CoqProject` file includes:

This ensures that the `Formalization` namespace is correctly applied, and the dependencies are resolved during compilation.

Progress and Milestones

1. **Complex Number Framework (`define_complex.v`):**
- Defines the `C` type for complex numbers.
- Implements basic operations (addition, multiplication, conjugation, etc.).
- Introduces placeholders for gamma, trigonometric, and exponential functions.

2. **Trigonometric and Exponential Constants (`trigonometric_exponential_constants.v`):**
- Builds on `define_complex.v` to formalize trigonometric and exponential functions.
- Includes example theorems as placeholders for further development.

Screenshots
The verification of the components in Coq is documented with the following screenshots:
- `define_complex_check_screenshot.png`
- `shadow_function_degree_check_screenshot.png`

3.Hadamard Term Testing
To validate the Hadamard product structure, weâ€™ve split the implementation into two separate test files:
- `hadamard_term_test.v` for handling terms associated with non-trivial zeros.
- `hadamard_term_pole_test.v` for handling terms associated with trivial poles.

These files test individual terms, ensuring correctness before combining them into the full Hadamard product

4. Degree Computation Formalization (`shadow_function_degree.v`)
The degree computation is a crucial element in the proof. It involves:
- Defining zeropoles to represent zeros and poles conceptually.
- Utilizing `aleph_null` as a placeholder for conceptual infinity.
- Computing the minimal degree of shadow functions with explicit type handling for integers.
