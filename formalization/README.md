# Formalization of the Riemann Hypothesis Proof via Zeropole Balance

This repository contains an ongoing formalization of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) proof, leveraging the Zeropole Balance framework, using the Coq proof assistant. The aim is to ensure the mathematical rigor of the proof, enabling its verification in a formal environment.

## Key Components

### 1. Degree Computation Formalization
The degree computation is a crucial element in the proof. It involves:
- Defining zeropoles to represent zeros and poles conceptually.
- Utilizing `aleph_null` as a placeholder for conceptual infinity.
- Computing the minimal degree of shadow functions with explicit type handling for integers.

### 2. Complex Number Framework
The functional equation of the Riemann Zeta function requires a representation of complex numbers, gamma functions, and trigonometric functions. To address this, placeholders and logical definitions for:
- Complex numbers (`C` type),
- Gamma functions, and
- Riemann Zeta functions were introduced.

## Progress and Execution
1. **Degree Computation:** 
   - Implemented degree computation logic with aleph-null cancellation.
   - The file `shadow_function_degree.v` demonstrates verification steps and logical balance in zeropole representation.

2. **Complex Framework:**
   - Placeholders for the Gamma function and Riemann Zeta function were defined in `define_complex.v`.
   - The file establishes the groundwork for further formalization of the functional equation.
